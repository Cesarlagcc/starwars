<h3>Star Wars knights of the Old Republic</h3>

    	<div class="kotr-text">
    		<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#089;font-size:21px;">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</span> is a roleplaying game made originally for the Microsoft Xbox and later released for the PC and is also avaliable on iPhone, iPad and Android devices. The game was developed by BioWare and published by LucasArts for Xbox on July 15, 2003, for PCs running Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2003, and later for Mac OS X on September 7, 2004. Set 3,956 years before A New Hope, Knights of the Old Republic covers the era just after that of the Tales of the Jedi comics, the time of the ancient Galactic Republic.</p>
            
            <p>KOTOR is the first computer RPG set in the Star Wars universe. It uses the d20 System, from the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars Roleplaying Game rules. The game also allows the player to either be a servant to the light side of the Force or the dark side, using an alignment system that tracks actions, from simple dialogue choices to major plot decisions. Combat is turn-based. Time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack/react simultaneously. However, the number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While each round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time (around six seconds), the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round.</p>
            <p>A sequel—Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords—was developed by a different studio, Obsidian Entertainment, using an updated version of the engine from the first game. Bioware was occupied with producing Jade Empire and wanted to focus more on their original productions than licensed games, but they recommended Obsidian for KotOR's sequel. It was released for Xbox a year later, in December 2004, and PC in February 2005.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
